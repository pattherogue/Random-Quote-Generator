# Random-Quote-Generator
 
Created an application that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. 

Utilized knowledge of Javascript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and object literals.

Built an array of quote objects to store the quotes.

Wrote own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
